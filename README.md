- 👋 Hi, I’m @aaronbraund - a hobbyist Python/SQL programmer who's passionate about data driven insights!
- 👀 I’m interested in data, AI, mathematics, statistics and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python, statistics and data analysis skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting data projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronbraund/
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a self taught Python/SQL user; most of my learning has come from W3Schools, Coursera and using ChatGPT to ask me questions about datasets.
- 1️⃣ Another fun fact: My profile picture was generated by DALL-E; it was a struggle to get something that looked like SQL and even though the Q looks more like a G, I'll live with it xD
